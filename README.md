# ML-Assigment-2---Playing-the-whole-game

Introduction
This assignment is an essential part of DAT158-ML! This is where you'll learn the most about practical machine learning, and you'll make use of the principles and best practices covered in class.

As in ML Assignment #1: End-to-end machine learning project, you'll step through a machine learning project, starting with a problem description and some data via a system that can produce valuable predictions and, finally, a deployed model.

You will have a lot of flexibility in your choice of problem to investigate and technologies to use. You'll find a list of some recommended data sources below, and the lectures of ML module 3: Playing the whole game – Practical ML will discuss and demonstrate possible ways to deploy models. But if you choose to solve the assignment using completely different tools and technologies, that is completely fine as long as your work satisfies the following criteria.

The assignment has two steps: first, you will design a practical machine learning project, and then you will do some hands-on work to at least partially do your proposed project. Note that your proposed project will likely be larger and more comprehensive than what you will actually complete during the assignment.


Requirements

1. You should work in groups of 2-4 students.

2.You are expected to adhere to the description of the ML lifecycle presented in ML module 3: Playing the whole game – Practical ML and to address the various challenges for practical machine learning-based projects described therein.

3. You must write a short report using the following template: [Norwegian Download Norwegian], [English Download English]. I recommend that you start writing the report as soon as possible and then update it after you've conducted some hands-on experiments. A tip: to co-write the report, use Office365 or upload the template to Google Docs.

4. You have to create and use a GitHub repository for your project. It has to contain all the code and documentation needed to understand what you did and how. It must also contain your written report. You will submit a link to this repository to Canvas before the deadline. If the repository is private, you must add me (user alu042) as a collaborator before submitting.

5. The code and notebooks must be well-documented and, of course, not plagiarized. If you incorporate other people's code in your solutions, make sure that you fully understand what the code does and that you cite the source.

6. You have to deploy your system.

7. It has to be easy for others to reproduce your results.

8. You must create a short video demonstrating how one can interact with your deployed model or, alternatively and even better, make it available by hosting it online.


Some inspiration and possible data sources
These are suggestions. You are free to use other data sources. If you choose something that is not on the below list, I recommend that you contact me to discuss its feasibility. It is easy to end up with an idea that will be very challenging and time-consuming to pursue.

Remember that the data you choose to work with must be linked to the report you write.

Kaggle is a good source of data and inspiration. You may find it helpful to browse through the competition catalog: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions Links to an external site..

Creating your own data set is also an idea. Perhaps using a web scraper? Beautiful Soup and Scrapy are excellent libraries for this:

Housing prices [Kaggle tutorial competition]
"With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home."

Link: House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. See also: Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users.

Note: The problem studied in this competition is similar to what you did in assignment 1. You should use what you learned there if you choose this data set. Also, note that you will find detailed tutorials on Kaggle as this is a “tutorial competition”.

Note: This is a forecasting task, something you may be unfamiliar with (but no time like the present to learn!).

How to submit
Submit a link to your GitHub repo here on Canvas. (If your repo is private, remember to invite me as a collaborator).
